							Hello! I'm Brian Harney, a passionate Software Engineer at Microsoft, based in the
							vibrant city of Chicago. I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to build incredible
							software and contribute to the ever-evolving world of web development. But before we
							dive into the tech talk, let me introduce you to my furry companions – Abe, my amazing

							<strong>The Changing Landscape of Web Development:</strong>
						</p>
						<p className="col fs-4">
							In recent years, the web has undergone a remarkable transformation. The integration of
							Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the power of JavaScript have paved the way for a new
							era of web experiences. As a software engineer, I've had the privilege of witnessing
							and contributing to this evolution firsthand. Our world is becoming more connected,
							demanding web services that are resilient, lightning-fast, and always available. This
							has raised our expectations for web applications, prompting us to rethink how we share
							code and ideas. It's an exciting time to be in the field of web development, and I'm
							eager to share my insights and experiences with you.

							<strong>Navigating the Rapid Changes: </strong>
						</p>
						<p className="col fs-4">
							I understand that keeping up with the breakneck pace of technological advancements in
							the web world can be overwhelming. The web evolves at a mile a minute, and it's not
							always easy to stay in the loop. That's why I'm here – to help demystify these changes
							and provide you with valuable insights. Thanks for visiting, and feel free to reach
							out if you have any questions or simply want to chat about tech, Chicago, or, of
							course, Abe and Goldie!
